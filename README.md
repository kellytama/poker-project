# Project Overview
Simplified Poker Game

1. Player begins with $10 and bets $1 for each hand played. Game ends when player has $0.
2. After new hand is dealt, player can replace 1 of 5 cards, can enter '0' to not replace, or a number between 1 - 5 that indicates which card they want to replace.
3. Computer can also replace cards using an algorithm that replaces the lowest value card. If there are 2 low cards of equal value, it takes the first one. If none of the cards are a 7 or less, it keeps all its cards. It does not choose to replace a card to get a flush, but if it has a flush, it keeps it and does not take any cards. (A flush is all card are of the same suit, Spade, Club, Diamond, or Heart.)
4. After cards are replaced, a winner is decided
5. Winning hand is defined by
  (a) flush
  (b) value of cards is added to create score
    i. 2 = 1 pt
       3 = 2 pts
       ...
       10 = 9 pts
       Jack = 10 pts
       Queen = 11 pts
       King = 12 pts
       Ace = 13 pts
  (c) dealer wins all ties
